    <h2>Docker Manager Version</h2>
    <div class="info">
        <p>This version of Omnitool.ai uses Docker to simplify installation.</p> 
        <p>The small 'docker manager' you are now running will do most of the work.</p>
        <p>And even guide you to download Docker Desktop if you don't have it yet.</p> 
        <p>This window will be replaced by the Omnitool.ai Window when it is ready.</p>
