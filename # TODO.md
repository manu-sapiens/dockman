# TODO
- Pull docker image (But what does that mean for the integrity of the data such as recipes?)
- It means we must use tag / version and only update when
absolutely necessary...
- Also it would be good to have an export-all / import-all as an API
- Also, it would be good to save online (github?) instead of locally
